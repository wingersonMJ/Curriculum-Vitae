#### NeurIPS Submission:
1. Submitted work to NeurIPS 2025. 
    - **Project Summary:** This study introduces a neural network approach using ordinal embeddings of health-related behaviors to predict substance use risk. We propose that adjacent health-related behaviors can 
    predict substance use, and that a model with ordinal embeddings can successfully distinguish between adolescents using substances and non-users with enough success to be clinically feasible. We also demonstrate 
    improved generalizability to unseen data when including ordinal embedding in the model compared to traditional one-hot encoding of data, at least within the context of predicting adolescent substance use.

#### Side-Projects in Machine Learning:
1. A Patients-Like-Me Approach to Aggregating Data in Clinical Management of Adolescent Concussion.
    - **Project Summary:** Recovery after adolescent concussion is difficult to predict, and communicating realistic recovery timelines is equally challenging. A simple “patients-like-me” framework that aggregates recovery outcomes from past patients seen in the clinic can support clinical prognosis by setting individualized, data-driven recovery expectations based on prior patients who are most similar to a current patient. We used a reference cohort of 558 adolescents treated in a concussion clinic. Nine routinely collected demographic and injury-related variables defined a “Like-Me Cohort”: a subset of patients most similar to a given index patient based on Euclidean distance. This patients-like-me aggregation approach generates sub-cohorts that better reflect individual clinical presentations and recovery trajectories, offering an interpretable, data-driven complement to clinical management and supporting patient-centered discussions of expected recovery.
